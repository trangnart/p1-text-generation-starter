# The endless dream

Statement: It's a challenge to come up with a story built with words related to good, bad, and humor. Randomness played an important role because it can control the storyline making the story can carry a special meaning, or make no sense, or be humorous.

Level of complexity:

1. replacing a single word with multiple ones of the same type: place -> heaven and hell
2. replacing a general word with one of several specific ones: feeling -> fear
3. add one additional type of replacement: $feeling kids
